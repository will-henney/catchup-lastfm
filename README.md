# Catch up missing years of scrobbling to last.fm

So now I have scrobbling working from my iPhone again (using Marvis Pro), I would like to fill in all the years I missed (2016 to 2021).

## Cunning plan

    * [ ] Export data from iTunes library as CSV
	* [ ] Read CSV file with pandas
	* [ ] Select the time period we want
	* [ ] Use the last.fm API to scrobble the traacks with the right date specified
	* [ ] Voila
